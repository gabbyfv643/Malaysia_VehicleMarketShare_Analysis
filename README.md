## Key Factors

Understanding the vehicle market in Malaysia requires a look at various factors:

- **Oil Prices**: Fluctuations in oil prices significantly impact vehicle sales, especially for ICE vehicles.
- **Government Policies**: Incentives for EVs and regulations on emissions influence consumer choices.
- **Consumer Preferences**: Shifts in consumer behavior towards sustainability affect market dynamics.
- **Infrastructure Development**: Availability of charging stations plays a crucial role in EV adoption.

## Data Sources

Data for this analysis comes from multiple reliable sources:

- **Government Reports**: Statistics on vehicle registrations and oil prices.
- **Market Research Firms**: Reports on consumer trends and market forecasts.
- **Academic Journals**: Studies on the environmental impact of different vehicle types.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabbyfv643/Malaysia_VehicleMarketShare_Analysis.git
cd Malaysia_VehicleMarketShare_Analysis
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After setting up the repository, you can run the analysis scripts. Make sure to have the necessary data files in the correct directory. Execute the main script as follows:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will generate the analysis and visualizations based on the data provided.

## Analysis Techniques

This project employs several analytical techniques:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial analysis to understand data distributions and trends.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Investigating patterns over time, especially in oil prices and vehicle sales.
- **Modeling**: Using VARX and VECM models to forecast future trends.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps identify patterns and anomalies in the data. Key steps include:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the main characteristics of the data.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between variables.

### Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis focuses on data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. Key techniques include:

- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying long-term movements in the data.
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Breaking down data into seasonal components.
- **Forecasting**: Predicting future values based on historical data.

### Modeling

Using advanced models like VARX (Vector Autoregression with Exogenous Variables) and VECM (Vector Error Correction Model) allows for a deeper understanding of the relationships between variables. 

- **VARX**: Useful for capturing the linear interdependencies among multiple time series.
- **VECM**: Effective for analyzing cointegrated time series data, providing insights into long-term relationships.

## Visualizations

Visual representations are key to understanding the data. This project includes various visualizations:

- **Line Charts**: To show trends over time.
- **Bar Graphs**: To compare market shares of different vehicle types.
- **Heatmaps**: To illustrate correlations between variables.

Hereâ€™s an example of a visualization:
